# Portfolio
Hey, it's my portfolio site. Visit [itsdivik.github.io](https://itsdivik.github.io) to view it. If you find any bug/error or if you want to help me improve the site then feel free to contact me below. Constructive criticism is always welcomed and appreciated.

### UPDATE:
* The contact form is now working(I've closed the issue related to it too).

## NOTE:
* GitHub doesn't support PHP, so the PHP part(contactform.php) has not been linked to the main file(index.html). ~~Instead to send the mail I've used the mailto attribute.~~
* ~~The contact form doesn't work for android. If you wish to contact then tap on my email and it will bring up gmail or your default mailer.~~ (It would still work, but you can use the contact form for this purpose too)

## Technologies Used:
1. **HTML/CSS**
2. **JS(JQuery)**
3. **Sass**
4. **PHP**
